# Notes: Build a basic layout

- The **Layout Editor** helps you create the UI for your Android app.
- Almost everything you see on the screen of your app is a `View`.
- A `TextView` is a UI element for displaying text in your app.
- A `ConstraintLayout` is a container for other UI elements.
- `Views` need to be constrained horizontally and vertically within a `ConstraintLayout`.
- One way to position a `View` is with a margin.
- A margin says how far a `View` is from an edge of the container it's in.
- You can set attributes on a `TextView` like the font, text size, and color.

- The **Resource Manager** in Android Studio helps you add and organize your images and other resources.
- An `ImageView` is a UI element for displaying images in your app.
- `ImageViews` should have a content description to help make your app more accessible.
- Text that is shown to the user like the birthday greeting should be extracted into a string resource to make it easier to translate your app into other languages.
